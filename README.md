# CI601 - Final Year Project
## Upgrade - A Bespoke Customer Relationship Management and Point of Sale System for Up-grade Martial Arts

A local martial arts company, after having seen explosive growth in customers, have approached me with an issue they have recently become aware of.

As of writing, their only method of tracking customers, payments and lessons is via hand written notes, spreadsheets and carbon copies from the till. (Manual system with no style or structure)

With the influx of new customers, they have not seen an equal return financially which has lead them to believe some students are attending without paying or are confused with how the payment method works.

Due to the requirement of tracking lessons and how the prices correlate with bulk lesson purchases, currently existing CRM and PoS systems fail to fufill their requirements.

I have been tasked with creating a new system to track customer information (such as parent contact details in emergencies or emails for cancelled lessons), their payments for lessons and items as well as a method of viewing this data in a friendly format.

I have been given permission to use their intellectual property and any documentation required to aide in the design and development of the new system which they have confirmed they will use to replace the current one.
