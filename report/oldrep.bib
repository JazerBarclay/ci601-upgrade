	abstract = {IT projects emerge from a business need. In practice, software developers must accomplish two big things before an IT project can begin: find out what you need to do (i.e., analyse business requirements) and plan out how to do it (i.e., project management). The biggest problem in IT projects is delivering the wrong product because IT people do not understand what business people require. This practical textbook teaches computer science students how to manage and deliver IT projects by linking business and IT requirements with project management in an incremental and straightforward approach. Business Analysis, Requirements, and Project Management: A Guide for Computing Students presents an approach to analysis management that scales the business perspective. It takes a business process view of a business proposal as a model and explains how to structure a technical problem into a recognisable pattern with problem frames. It shows how to identify core transactions and model them as use cases to create a requirements table useful to designers and coders. Linked to the analysis are three management tools: the product breakdown structure (PBS), the Gantt chart, and the Kanban board. The PBS is derived in part from the problem frame. The Gantt chart emerges from the PBS and ensures the key requirements are addressed by reference to use cases. The Kanban board is especially useful in Task Driven Development, which the text covers.  This textbook consists of two interleaving parts and features a single case study. Part one addresses the business and requirements perspective. The second integrates core project management approaches and explains how both requirements and management are connected. The remainder of the book is appendices, the first of which provides solutions to the exercises presented in each chapter. The second appendix puts together much of the documentation for the case study into one place. The case study presents a real-word business scenario to expose students to professional practice.},

It is therefore important to investigate the characteristics of some of the possibilities available for students to run Windows and Linux applications, if possible at the same time, on the same computer.

The tests use simple C code that targets process creation, application performance and inter-process communication performance. The conclusions show the advantages and disadvantages of using each solution for running Linux applications in a Windows host.},

The invention of Smartphone especially and after the launch of Android OS which is free there is a huge increase in the use of smartphones. Most of the users use native mobile applications for browsing the contents of the particular industry. The other way is to browse the contents is through a web browser. But both the ways have limitations. The first way which is the native app, user is required to download the app firstly and then they must use it as per their requirements. This has two major disadvantages, one is it takes space on local storage of smartphone device and the network connection must be strong enough to operate it smoothly. The areas where 2G or lesser bandwidth or 3G network is available, it becomes a slow process to access this native app. The second way which is through the web browser has disadvantages since the user experience is not as great as native app. In order to overcome the above limitations, Google has provided a solution of Progressive Web App (PWA) which combines the best of web and mobile apps giving us a rich experience just like the native apps. It is a website built using web technologies that acts like an app. PWA is a website built using web technologies that acts like an app and is not required to be installed like a native app.},
